# Redux_Demos
#### Redux scratch to hero code in this file for react store process!!
simple store process!!

- one_reducer.js  : Reducer is a function that accepts the state & action as parameter & returns a new state!
* store.js        : Create Store method accepts a reducer fuuncton as its parameter!


  #### Note:
  First we have defined our action an object & we have defined our "action creator" that can returns an object!
  then we are implementing the reducer "Reducer is a function that accepts the state & action as parameter & returns a new state"

## Hook
* useSelector:  useSelector is hook the react-redux library provides which acts as close equivilent to map state to props function we have already seen!
- // to get hold of any state that is maintained in redux store we use the useSelector hook!
